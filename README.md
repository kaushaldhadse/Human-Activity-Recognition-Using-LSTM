# Human Activity Recognition Using LSTM Deep Learning


This project gives a step-by-step explanation on how to build a Human activity Recognition (HAR) Model using Deep Learning. 

Human Activity Recognition is a topic on which wide research is going on. These activities are recognized using the sensor readings. The main goal of this project is to train a Deep Learning model using these readings for this task.

The dataset used here is UCI HAR Dataset. This dataset can be accessed [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones](Here).

The dataset contains signals from the Gyroscope and Accelerometer of a smartphone while doing six activities : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. 

The dataset contains Time-Series data, therefore LSTM model was the best choice for this task.
